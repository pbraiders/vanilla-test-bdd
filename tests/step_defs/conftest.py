"""
This module contains shared fixtures, steps, and hooks.

Fixture scopes
Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their scope:
    function: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.
    class: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.
    module: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.
    package: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package.
    session: the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.

Hooks
    pytest_bdd_before_scenario(request, feature, scenario) - Called before scenario is executed
    pytest_bdd_after_scenario(request, feature, scenario) - Called after scenario is executed (even if one of steps has failed)
    pytest_bdd_before_step(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func) - Called before step function is executed and itâ€™s arguments evaluated
    pytest_bdd_before_step_call(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func, step_func_args) - Called before step function is executed with evaluated arguments
    pytest_bdd_after_step(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func, step_func_args) - Called after step function is successfully executed
    pytest_bdd_step_error(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func, step_func_args, exception) - Called when step function failed to execute
    pytest_bdd_step_func_lookup_error(request, feature, scenario, step, exception) - Called when step lookup failed
