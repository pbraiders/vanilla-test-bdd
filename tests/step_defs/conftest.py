"""
This module contains shared fixtures, steps, and hooks.

Fixture scopes
Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their scope:
    function: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.
    class: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.
    module: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.
    package: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package.
    session: the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.
