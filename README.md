[![Lint](https://github.com/pbraiders/vanilla-test-bdd/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/pbraiders/vanilla-test-bdd/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/pbraiders/vanilla-test-bdd/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/pbraiders/vanilla-test-bdd/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

Behavioral driven development library for [PBRaiders Vanilla](https://github.com/pbraiders/vanilla) using [pytest-bdd](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd) and [pytest-splinter](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-splinter)

## Requirements

- pbraiders: latest vanilla
- python: ^3.9
- python3-pip: ^21.1
- python3-venv: ^3.9
- python modules: selenium, pytest, pytest-bdd, pytest-splinter
- web drivers: chromium-chromedriver or/and firefox-geckodriver

## Installation

*On Ubuntu Desktop 20.10*

### Installing PBRaiders

Install the latest [PBRaiders vanilla version](https://github.com/pbraiders/vanilla) using the [documentation](https://github.com/pbraiders/vanilla/blob/master/doc/install/install.fr_FR.md)

### Installing Web Drivers

A driver is required to interact with the specified browser. Each browser has a particular
Selenium WebDriver associated with it, so you need to install any one of the drivers
provided; for example, geckodriver is a Selenium WebDriver that only operates with
Mozilla Firefox.

Run:

```bash
apt-get install chromium-chromedriver firefox-geckodriver
```

### Installing Python

This project requires an up-to-date version of Python 3. Run:

```bash
apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

### Installing Python modules

This project uses [venv](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/venv.html) to manage packages in an virtual environment.
To set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone it from this GitHub repository.
2. Run: `python3 -m venv .venv` from the command line in the project's root directory to create the virtual environment.
3. Run: `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
4. Run: `pip install --upgrade pip` to uprade pip.
5. Run: `pip install --upgrade setuptools` to uprade setuptools.
6. Run: `pip install wheel ; pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary packages.

## Running the tests

Go to the [tests](tests) folder and update the website [configuration file](tests/config.json)

Once the virtual environment activated, the command used to run the tests is `python -m pytest`.
Also, there is a provision to run the tests by providing the tag names.
It can be achieved by appending `-k` and the tag name. e.g. `python -m pytest -k adm`

This framework uses pytest-html plugin to generate html reports for the test runs.
To generate a report, run the command pipenv run python -m pytest -k automated --html=report.html
